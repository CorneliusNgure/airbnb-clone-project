This project is the backend system of an Airbnb Clone.  
Its objective is to provide a robust, scalable API that supports core platform functionalities such as user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.  
The goal is to deliver a seamless and reliable experience for both users and hosts.

## üèÜ Project Goals

- Secure user registration, authentication, and profile management  
- Property listing creation, update, retrieval, and deletion  
- Booking creation and management  
- Payment processing for bookings  
- Review and rating system  
- Optimized data storage and retrieval with caching and indexing  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Django** | Core web framework / ORM |
| **Django REST Framework** | RESTful API |
| **GraphQL** | Flexible data querying |
| **PostgreSQL** | Relational database |
| **Celery** | Asynchronous task processing |
| **Redis** | Caching and session management |
| **Docker** | Containerization of services |
| **CI/CD Pipelines** | Automated testing and deployment |

##  Team Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Backend Developer** | Builds and maintains the REST and GraphQL APIs; writes business logic and data models using Django and Django REST Framework. |
| **Database Administrator (DBA)** | Designs database schemas, sets up indexing and optimizations in PostgreSQL to ensure fast retrieval and data consistency. |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Automates deployment pipelines, handles Docker containerization, CI/CD processes, and streamlines scalability and monitoring. |
| **QA Engineer** | Develops test plans, executes manual and automated tests, ensures functionality works as expected and prevents regressions‚Äîcritical for high quality :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. |
| **Project Manager (or Agile Facilitator)** | Coordinates the team‚Äôs work, maintains timelines and deliverables, mitigates risks, and keeps communication flowing. A PM helps keep the project on track and aligned with its goals.

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Design

| Entity | Key Fields | Description / Relationships |
|-------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **User** | `id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, `date_joined` | A user can be a host or guest. A single user may own multiple properties and can create multiple bookings and reviews. |
| **Property** | `id`, `host_id`, `title`, `location`, `price_per_night` | Each property belongs to a user (host). A property can have many bookings and reviews. |
| **Booking** | `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out` | A booking is created by a user for a specific property. Each booking belongs to a single user **and** a single property. |
| **Payment** | `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `status` | Payments are tied to a single booking. Each booking has **one** related payment. |
| **Review** | `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment` | Users can leave reviews for properties. A single property can have many reviews; each review is linked to one user and one property. |

### üîó Entity Relationships (Quick summary)

- **User ‚Üí Property** : *One-to-Many* ‚Äî a user (host) can own multiple properties  
- **User ‚Üí Booking** : *One-to-Many* ‚Äî a user (guest) can make multiple bookings  
- **Property ‚Üí Booking** : *One-to-Many* ‚Äî each property can have multiple bookings  
- **Booking ‚Üí Payment** : *One-to-One* ‚Äî each booking has one corresponding payment  
- **User + Property ‚Üí Review** : a user can leave multiple reviews, and a property can receive multiple review.

## üîß Feature Breakdown

**User Management**
Handles user registration, authentication, and profile updates. This ensures that both hosts and guests can securely access the platform and manage their account information.

**Property Management**
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. This forms the backbone of the platform by enabling the availability of properties for guests to browse and book.

**Booking System**
Enables users to reserve properties for specific dates and manage their booking details. It ensures availability is tracked and prevents double-booking of listings.

**Payment Processing**
Processes payments associated with confirmed bookings and records transaction details. This feature ensures a secure and traceable flow of money between guests and hosts.

**Review System**
Lets users leave ratings and feedback on properties they have stayed in. Reviews help increase trust and provide valuable insight to future guests when choosing a property.

**API Documentation**
Provides detailed, standardized API documentation (via OpenAPI and GraphQL schemas). This allows developers to easily understand and integrate with the backend.

## üîê API Security

To ensure the platform remains safe and trustworthy for all users, the backend implements several security measures:

**Authentication**
All endpoints require proper authentication (e.g., token-based) so that only verified users can access protected resources. This prevents unauthorized access and helps protect sensitive user data.

**Authorization**
Role-based access control is enforced to ensure users can only perform actions they are allowed to (e.g., a user cannot update another user‚Äôs profile or modify a property they don‚Äôt own). This protects user-owned content and prevents abuse.

**Rate Limiting**
API requests are rate-limited to prevent abuse and protect the service from brute-force or denial-of-service attacks. This helps ensure the platform remains performant and available for all legitimate users.

**Secure Payment Handling**
All payment-related operations are handled through secure and encrypted channels. This is essential for protecting financial data and preventing fraudulent transactions.

**Input Validation & Sanitization**
Incoming request data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and other malicious behavior. This helps maintain the integrity of the system and protect the database.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

**Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** are development practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code.
They help ensure that new changes are validated early and delivered reliably to production without manual intervention.

In this project, CI/CD pipelines play a critical role in providing:

- **Automated Testing:** every commit is automatically tested to prevent bugs from being introduced into the main branch.
- **Consistent Builds:** using Docker, we ensure that each build runs in the same environment, reducing ‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù issues.
- **Fast and Reliable Deployment:** changes can be deployed quickly and safely, improving delivery speed while maintaining quality.

**Tools Used**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GitHub Actions** | Automates build, test, and deployment workflows |
| **Docker** | Provides a consistent runtime environment for every build and deployment |
| **Docker Hub / GitHub Container Registry** | Stores versioned container images used in the deployment process |
